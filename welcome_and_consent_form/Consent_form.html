    <h2>CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>
    <p><strong>Protecting Your Privacy in this Study</strong></p>
    <p>We will take steps to help make sure that all the information we get about you is kept confidential. Your name will not be used wherever possible. We will use a code instead. All the study data that we get from you will be kept locked up. The code will be locked up too. If any papers and talks are given about this research, your name will not be used. </p>
    <p>All the information we get about you will be kept private. In order to pay you, we do collect your Amazon MTurk ID number. However, we cannot use this ID number to learn anything else about you. The only information we know about you is what you decide to tell us in the course of this survey. In accordance with the rules and regulations of Amazon Mechanical Turk, we as the researchers cannot request any information that could be used to identify you. All the study data that we get from you will be kept locked up. If any papers and talks are given about this research, your data will only be presented in an aggregated form.  Your name will not be collected and will therefore not be connected to any answers you provide as part of the study. </p>
