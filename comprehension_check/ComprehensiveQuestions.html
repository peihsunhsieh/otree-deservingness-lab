<div style="text-align: left;">Before the experiment starts, we want to ask you some comprehension questions about the procedure to 
    make sure that you understood everything. <u>If you answer three or more questions wrong, you will not be able to continue the 
        study.</u> To ensure that you have a correct understanding of the decision-making environment that you face in this study, we will give you the 
        correct answer for each question whether or not your initial answer is correct. <br></div>
