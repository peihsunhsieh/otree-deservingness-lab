<p><strong>The counting tasks: </strong>You will be shown one or more tables consisting of many ones and zeros. You can earn either 
    $0.1 per table or $0.2 per table, depending on the wage you are assigned in the wage rate assignment stage, by completing each 
    table with the correct answer about how many zeros there are in a table. The maximum number of tables you can complete is ten, but 
    how many tables you want to complete from that maximum number is totally&nbsp;<u>up to you</u>. In other words, you can choose to 
    complete any number of tables up to a maximum of ten.</p>
