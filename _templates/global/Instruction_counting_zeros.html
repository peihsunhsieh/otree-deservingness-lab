<p><strong>The counting tasks: </strong>You will be shown one or more tables consisting of many ones and zeros. You can earn either 
    ${{ session.low_wage_rate }} per table or ${{ session.high_wage_rate }} per table, depending on the wage you are assigned in the wage rate assignment stage, by completing each 
    table with the correct answer about how many zeros there are in a table. The maximum number of tables you can get paid for completing is ten, but 
    how many tables you want to complete is totally&nbsp;<u>up to you</u>.  In other words, you can choose to complete and get paid for any number of tables up to a maximum of ten.</p>
