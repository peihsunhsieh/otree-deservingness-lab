<p><strong>Wage rate assignment: </strong>You will be assigned a wage rate for the counting task you will do later. 
    In the counting task, you will be shown one or more tables consisting of many ones and zeros. You can earn a bonus per table by 
    completing each table with the correct answer about how many zeros there are in a table. The bonus is either ${{ session.low_wage_rate }} per correct 
    table or ${{ session.high_wage_rate }} per correct table, randomly assigned in this stage. <strong>Everyone has a {{p_lowwage}} probability of being 
        assigned ${{ session.low_wage_rate }} per table as the wage rate and {{p_highwage}} probability of being assigned ${{ session.high_wage_rate }} per table as the wage 
        rate.</strong> This probability is the same no matter whom you may interact with during this study.</p>
