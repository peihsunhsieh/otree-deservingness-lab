<p><strong>Wage rate assignment: </strong>You will be assigned a wage rate for the counting task you will do later. 
    In the counting task, you will be shown one or more tables consisting of many ones and zeros. You can earn a bonus per table by 
    completing each table with the correct answer about how many zeros there are in a table. The bonus is either 10 cents per correct 
    table or 20 cents per correct table, randomly assigned in this stage. <strong>Everyone has a {{p_lowwage}} probability of being 
        assigned 10 cents per table as the wage rate and {{p_highwage}} probability of being assigned 20 cents per table as the wage 
        rate.</strong> This probability is the same whom you may interact with during this study.</p>
