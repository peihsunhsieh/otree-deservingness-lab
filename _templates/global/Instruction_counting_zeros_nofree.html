<p><strong>The counting tasks: </strong>You will be shown one or more tables consisting of many ones and zeros. You can earn either 10 cents per table or 20 cents per table, depending on the wage you are assigned in the wage rate assignment stage, by completing each table with the correct answer about how many zeros there are in a table. The maximum number of tables you can complete is ten, but how many tables you want to complete from that maximum number is totally&nbsp;<u>up to you</u>. In other words, you can choose to complete any number of tables up to a maximum of ten. Once you start to do a table, you cannot choose to skip the table.</p>
